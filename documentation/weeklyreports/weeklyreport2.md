# Weekly report 2 

During the beginning of this week, my focus was primarily on delving deeper into understanding the Markov chain algorithm and trie data structure. With a clarified understanding of the Markov chain, I started the implementation phase within my project framework, using a trie data structure for data storage.

Starting with the coding part was challenging, and I encountered several problems along the way. While I made some progress, there are still a few issues in the Markov chain algorithm that need to be fixed.

Understanding how to calculate probabilities for selecting the next note is currently a bit tricky for me. However, I'm planning to dedicate more time to this aspect next week. 

Right now, the algorithm randomly selects a note from the input sequence provided by the user. Then, it generates a series of notes of the desired length using the Markov chain algorithm.

Throughout this week, I dedicated approximately 18 hours of work on my project. I did a lot of research, and it took time for me to understand how the algorithm and data structure works.

My aim for the upcoming week is to have the main features of the algorithm ready and to be able to create sequences of notes efficiently using the Markov chain algorithm. Additionally, I will improve the user interface and validation of user inputs. I will also develop unit tests for my project.
