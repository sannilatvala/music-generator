# Weekly report 6

Throughout this week, my primary focus was on enhancing the functionality of the Markov chain algorithm. I dedicated a significant amount of time to rectify existing issues within the algorithm, ensuring its accuracy and efficiency. Notably, I revised and updated the trie.py module by integrating new functionalities for searching sequences of notes and extracting subsequent notes and transition probabilities following a specific note sequence.

Another notable achievement this week was giving users the possibility to provide multiple MIDI files as input data. This advancement enriches the amount of data utilized by the Markov chain for music generation, and therefore enhances the quality of generated outputs. Additionally I expanded the selection of input data files.

I also made one more test to my markov chain. This test ensures that the generated sequence consists of note chains (length = ngram+1) that are present in the original sequences. This ensures that the algorithm works correctly.

Challenges encountered during the week primarily revolved around refining the algorithm as well as giving the user the possibility to choose multiple files as input.

I also started creating the testing document this week. Next week I will complete the implementation and testing documentation including all the requried parts.

Throughout this week, I dedicated approximately 12 hours to my project, primarily focusing on refining the Markov chain algorithm, developing a comprehensive testing document, and enhancing the functionality of the user interface. 

Looking ahead to the next week, the focus will be in the task of selecting the relevant channel from MIDI files containing the melody. While achieving this remains somewhat uncertain, dedicated exploration and research will be done to find an effective solution.

Furthermore, efforts will be directed towards the implementation of thorough documentation, including comments and docstrings for methods and classes, ensuring clarity across the project codebase.
