# Weekly report 5

This week I focused on refining the project's codebase and improving the user interface. I also created functionalities for playing the music to elevate the user experience. This allows users to play the generated music without the need for external software for playing the MIDI file. For this, I created the midi_player.py module, which utilizes pygame's mixer module for playing the music. 

In addition, I added two new MIDI files, "RiverFlowsInYou.mid" and "FurElise.mid", to the dataset. These files were downloaded from the freemidi.org website. This expansion broadens the user's selection, enhancing the user experience. I also created an assets folder to organize the input files efficiently.

Furthermore, I made some adjustments to the downloadable MIDI files in module create_and_save_midi(),to enhance the sound quality of the music. 

In terms of testing, I focused on enhancing test coverage. I also started doing integration testing to test the interactions between different components and modules and ensured they work together as expected. In addition, I did end-to-end testing to simulate real-world user scenarios. I also started working on the implementation document. 

While I didn't encounter any major obstacles this week, I dedicated a lot of time and effort on my project. With the main functionalities now in place, the upcoming week I will prioritize documentation enhancements, including the implementation of docstrings and minor code fixes where necessary. I will also complete the testing and implementation documents. 

This week I spent approximately 18 hours on my project. The majority of this time was dedicated to validation processes, user interface enhancements, and addressing code optimizations to elevate the overall user experience.
